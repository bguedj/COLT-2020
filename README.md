### Mini-Conf

This website is forked from MiniConf. <a href="https://mini-conf.github.io/index.html">MiniConf</a> is a virtual conference in a box. It manages the papers, schedules, and speakers for an academic conference run virtually. It can be easily integrated with interactive tools such as video, chat, and QA. Mini-Conf was originally built to host <a href="https://iclr.cc/virtual_2020">ICLR 2020</a>.

See <a href="https://github.com/Mini-Conf/Mini-Conf">the repository</a> for more details, and for forking to host your own conference. Many thanks to the authors [Hendrik Strobelt](http://twitter.com/hen_str) and [Sasha Rush](http://twitter.com/srush_nlp) for their kind help!
